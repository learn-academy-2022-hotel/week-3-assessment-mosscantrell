# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is JSX? What is one syntax difference between HTML and JSX?

Your answer: JSX is a language used in React that allows HTML-like elements within JavaScript. One syntax difference between the two is that JSX is always wrapped in React fragments (<></>), whereas HTML is wrapped within an HTML tag (<html></html>).

Researched answer: JSX is a syntax extension to JavaScript that is often used with React. It describes the way that UI should be displayed using similar elements to HTML. One key difference between the two is that in JSX, you must return a single parent element. In HTML, however, you are not limited to the single parent element.

2. What is yarn? What file(s) are modified in a React application when you run the command yarn in your terminal?

Your answer: Yarn is short for "Yet Another Resource Negotiator", and it functions as a package manager for code. In all honestly, I am unsure what file(s) are modified by yarn in Reacr.

Researched answer: Yarn (Yet Another Resource Negotiator) is a package manager that allows you to store and share code with others. Though I searched for which file(s) yarn modifies, I was unable to find any resources that spoke about this unfortunately.

3. What is a React component?

Your answer: A React component is a snippet of code that is reusable and has functionality. There are class components and function components, each of which work similarly to JavaScript functions.

Researched answer: Components in React are bits of code that are independent from other code and can be reused. They function similarly to JavaScript functions, however a component is isolated and often returns HTML when called upon to be visible on a page.

4. What is the difference between state values and props in React?

Your answer: While state values and props in React have similarities, their main difference is how they are used. State works within a component, while props are passed to the component.

Researched answer: In React, state values and props have various similarities. However, the main difference is how they are used within a code. Similar to a function parameter, a prop must be passed to a component to be called upon. Conversely, state values are already within the component, simialr to variables in a function.

5. What is the DOM?

Your answer: The DOM is what displays interactions on a web page such as a click, typing in a box, hovering over text, etc. 

Researched answer: The DOM (Document Object Model) allows a web page to access and display content and interactions dynamically. These are triggered by event listeners-- code within an application that listens for DOM events and communicate what needs to be executed.

6. STRETCH: Which is the difference between a div and a span?

Your answer: A div creates invisible dividers between specified sections of code, usually in order to design and call on blocks of text. A span does nearly the same thing, except it does so for inline text rather than large chunks.

Researched answer: Div and span are both HTML tags that section off bits of a web page in order to make styling and calling upon these sections easier. However, div groups together large blocks of a web page, while span is used for inline text editing.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Object-oriented programming: Object-oriented programming (shortened to OOP) is a programming model that revolves itself around objects, rather than functions.

2. Ruby: Ruby is a scripting language that is open source and object oriented, written in a text file and then converted into code.

3. Implicit return: In Ruby, the implicit return is the result of the final line, prior to the specified end keyword.

4. Ruby blocks: Ruby blocks are the lines of code found within the 'do' and 'end' keywords of a Ruby file.

5. Ruby hashes: In Ruby, a hash is a collection comprised of unique keys and their corresponding values, similar to an array.
